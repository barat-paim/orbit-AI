# Changelog

## 18.12.1 - **User Connects to TypeRacer (or other Platform via API)**

From what I can see in the frontend:
✅ Connect user works perfectly
✅ User stats are displayed correctly
❌ Fetch data is failing

## 18.12.2 - **User Database allows Fetch & Store Data from TypeRacer API**

🎉 Excellent! We've successfully implemented the user connection flow with data fetching and storage. Let's recap what we've achieved:

1. ✅ User connection with TypeRacer API
2. ✅ Display of user stats in the sidebar
3. ✅ Fetching race history data
4. ✅ Storing race data in PostgreSQL with proper UPSERT handling
5. ✅ Error handling and user feedback

files: 
- `backend/app/routes/user.py`
- `backend/app/utils/database.py`
- `backend/app/utils/fetch_data.py`
- `backend/app/utils/upsert_data.py`

The UI looks clean and professional, and the backend is handling the data reliably. This is a solid foundation for the rest of the application.


## 18.12.3 - **UI Styling**

🎉 Excellent! We've successfully fixed the UI styling by:

1. ✅ Properly importing the global CSS
2. ✅ Setting up the dark theme correctly
3. ✅ Maintaining the Geist font configuration
4. ✅ Keeping the shadcn/ui components intact

The UI now matches the clean, professional design from the original template. The dark theme looks particularly sleek, and all the components are properly styled.

## 18.12.4 - **Code Generation & Execution**

🎉 Excellent! We've successfully implemented the code generation and execution flow. Let's recap what we've achieved:

1. ✅ Code generation using Anthropic
2. ✅ Error handling and code regeneration
3. ✅ Execution of generated code
4. ✅ Display of results and visualizations

files: 
- `app/routes/analysis.py`
- `app/utils/code_utils.py`
- `app/utils/prompts.py`
- `app/utils/variable_mapper.py`
- `app/utils/plotting.py`

The backend is handling the data reliably, and the UI is displaying the results correctly. This is a solid foundation for the rest of the application.

## 18.12.5 - **CENTRAL ENGINE OF THE APPLICATION**

🎉 Absolutely! Let's celebrate this significant milestone! We've successfully:

1. ✅ Created a complete analysis pipeline that:
   - Generates code from natural language queries
   - Safely executes the code
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Produces both numerical results and visualizations

2. ✅ Successfully tested multiple query types:
   - Basic statistics (average WPM)
   - Time series analysis
   - Trend visualization
   - Performance analytics

3. ✅ Integrated all the components:
   - Claude API for code generation
   - Variable mapping for safety
   - Plotting utilities for visualization
   - Database operations for data access

4. ✅ Got clean, working output for all test cases!

This is a solid foundation for the analysis feature. The code is working exactly as intended, and we can now move forward with confidence to integrate it with the frontend. Great work! 🚀
