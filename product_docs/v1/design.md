# Integrated Workflow Summary for v1

## Step-by-Step:

**Data Pipeline:**

1. User triggers data ingestion for a specific platform and endpoint.
2. The router fetches data, normalizes it, and stores it in the database.
3. Users can retrieve data dynamically based on queries.

**Analysis Engine:**

1. User submits a query through the interface.
2. The generator selects the appropriate model (pre-trained or fine-tuned) and generates the analysis code.
3. Code is executed, and the results are passed to the visualizer.

**Visualization:**

1. The visualizer renders the results as plots or charts in the frontend.
2. Expandable to support custom visualizations in future updates.
