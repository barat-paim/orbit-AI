# Decision Log

## 1. Query first or data first?
Ans: We are going with query first. 

Why:
a. we want to deliver immediate value and get feedback from users (because we dont know about the users yet)
b. we want to gain traction and get users to use the platform
c. we want to fail so we know what to build next
d. we want the users to critique and hate it so we know what works and what doesn't
