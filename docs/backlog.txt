BACKLOG:

High Priority:
1. Add practice session data support
2. Implement head-to-head driver comparisons
3. Add sophisticated caching strategy
4. Create basic visualization capabilities
5. Add statistical analysis tools

Medium Priority:
6. Develop query builder interface
7. Implement parallel processing for non-rate-limited queries
8. Add trend analysis features
9. Create data visualization dashboard
10. Optimize memory usage for large datasets

Low Priority:
11. Add export capabilities for different formats
12. Implement real-time data updates
13. Create comprehensive API documentation
14. Add predictive modeling support
15. Create troubleshooting guides

NOTES:
- Current focus is on data enhancement and analysis features
- Need to maintain stability while adding new features
- Consider user interface development after core features are complete
- Documentation should be updated as new features are added
