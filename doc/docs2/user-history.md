To implement a feature where a user’s chat sessions are stored and displayed only when they are signed in, you can break the implementation down into these steps:

Technical Brief

Feature: Persistent and Visible Chat Sessions for Signed-In Users
Requirement: Display the chat sessions history to the signed-in user while ensuring data is stored securely and retrieved efficiently.

Key Technical Components
	1.	User Authentication
	•	Implement user sign-up and login functionality.
	•	Use secure tokens (e.g., JWT or OAuth) to authenticate API requests.
	•	Backend: Ensure signed-in status is checked before storing or retrieving chat sessions.
	2.	Session Storage
	•	Use a database to store chat sessions with fields:
	•	user_id: Links the session to the user.
	•	session_id: A unique identifier for each session.
	•	messages: Serialized or structured format for storing messages in a session.
	•	timestamp: Tracks when the session was created or updated.
	•	Example Table Schema:

CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
    session_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    messages JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);


	3.	API Endpoints
	•	Save Chat Session:
Endpoint to save messages to the user’s session.
Example: POST /api/v1/chat/session
	•	Request Body:

{
    "user_id": 1,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
}


	•	Backend Logic:
Save or update the session linked to user_id.

	•	Retrieve Sessions:
Endpoint to fetch all sessions for a user.
Example: GET /api/v1/chat/sessions
	•	Backend Logic:
Query database for sessions belonging to the authenticated user.

	4.	Frontend Integration
	•	After a user signs in, fetch chat sessions using the API and display them in a list.
	•	Allow users to resume or start new sessions.
	5.	Database Interaction
	•	Use an ORM (like SQLAlchemy or Prisma) to manage sessions.
	•	Ensure efficient queries using indexes on user_id and session_id.
	6.	Session Management Logic
	•	Backend:
	•	Verify user authentication before processing requests.
	•	Use user_id from the authenticated token to save/retrieve sessions.
	•	Frontend:
	•	Cache sessions locally to reduce API calls.
	•	Handle session creation and updates seamlessly.

Technical Terms
	1.	JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure user authentication.
	2.	ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Simplifies database interactions.
	3.	API Endpoint: A specific route that handles saving or retrieving sessions.
	4.	Session Persistence: Keeping chat data across sessions by storing it in a database.
	5.	Database Indexing: Optimizes query performance by indexing fields like user_id.
	6.	Frontend State Management: To manage and display chat sessions efficiently.
