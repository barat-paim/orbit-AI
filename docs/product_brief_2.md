# F1 Data Pipeline - Progress Report & Future Direction

## What We've Achieved

### 1. Robust Data Pipeline
- Successfully implemented a stable data pipeline with 100% success rate for both API fetches and DataFrame conversions
- Added intelligent circuit round mapping for accurate race-specific queries
- Implemented robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Added streaming response handling for large payloads

### 2. Data Normalization
- Standardized data processing for multiple endpoints:
  - Driver performance data
  - Qualifying results
  - Lap times
- Implemented consistent column naming and data type conversions
- Added comprehensive data validation at multiple stages

### 3. Circuit & Driver Mapping
- Created a centralized mapping system for:
  - Driver IDs and variations
  - Circuit names and their variants
  - Race round numbers by season
  - Circuit ID normalization
- Successfully integrated mapping system without disrupting existing functionality

### 4. Query Capabilities
Currently supporting:
- Driver performance across seasons
- Qualifying results with circuit-specific filtering
- Lap time analysis
- Driver statistics (wins, podiums, points, etc.)
- Circuit-specific performance queries

## Current Status
- API Fetch Success Rate: 100%
- DataFrame Conversion Success Rate: 100%
- Supported Endpoints: 
  - `/api/f1/drivers`
  - `/api/f1/qualifying`
  - `/api/f1/laps`
  - `/api/f1/constructors`
