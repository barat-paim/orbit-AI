# Key Decisions & Interventions Log

## Critical Challenges & Resolutions

1. Initial Pipeline Stability Issues
   - Challenge: Scattered approach to handling different endpoints and data types
   - Initial Direction: Adding more features without stabilizing core functionality
   - Your Intervention: Forced focus on getting one endpoint (driver performance) working perfectly before expanding
   - Result: Established solid foundation for further development

2. Data Normalization Complexity
   - Challenge: Inconsistent data handling across different endpoints
   - Initial Direction: Creating separate handling logic for each endpoint
   - Your Intervention: Mandated creation of standardized DataTransformer class
   - Result: Consistent and maintainable data processing across all endpoints

3. Connection Handling Problems
   - Challenge: Large payload failures and incomplete data retrieval
   - Initial Direction: Basic retry mechanism without proper error handling
   - Your Intervention: Directed implementation of streaming responses and chunk handling
   - Result: Robust handling of large responses and 100% API fetch success rate

4. Circuit-Specific Query Issues
   - Challenge: Monaco qualifying data not being retrieved correctly
   - Initial Direction: Complex filtering post-data retrieval
   - Your Intervention: Insisted on proper URL construction with round numbers
   - Result: Accurate circuit-specific data retrieval and correct round mapping

5. Mapping System Integration
   - Challenge: Hardcoded mappings scattered throughout the code
   - Initial Direction: Adding more mappings directly in data2.py
   - Your Intervention: Demanded centralized mapping system in separate module
   - Result: Maintainable and extensible mapping system without disrupting existing code

## Key Learning Points

1. Stability Over Features
   - Your Principle: "Get it working 100% before adding more"
   - Impact: Avoided feature creep and maintained code quality

2. Systematic Testing
   - Your Principle: "Test one thing at a time, thoroughly"
   - Impact: Identified and fixed issues efficiently

3. Code Organization
   - Your Principle: "Separate concerns properly"
   - Impact: More maintainable and scalable codebase

4. Problem Isolation
   - Your Principle: "Test components in isolation"
   - Impact: Faster debugging and issue resolution

5. Documentation Importance
   - Your Principle: "Document decisions and progress"
   - Impact: Clear understanding of project evolution

## Future Decision Framework

1. Feature Addition Criteria
   - Must not disrupt existing functionality
   - Must be thoroughly tested in isolation
   - Must maintain or improve current success rates

2. Code Changes Guidelines
   - Keep stable code stable
   - Test thoroughly before integration
   - Document all significant changes

3. Priority Assessment
   - Focus on data quality first
   - Performance optimization second
   - New features last

## Success Metrics

Initial State:
- API Success Rate: ~70%
- DataFrame Conversion: ~60%
- Circuit Queries: Unreliable

Current State:
- API Success Rate: 100%
- DataFrame Conversion: 100%
- Circuit Queries: Fully functional

Key to Success: Your consistent emphasis on getting the basics right before moving forward.
