# F1 Data Pipeline Project Brief

## Achievements

### 1. Query Processing System
- Implemented `QueryProcessor` for natural language query interpretation
- Successfully converts user queries into structured data requirements
- Handles various query types (races, qualifying, drivers, constructors)

### 2. Data Pipeline Implementation
- Created `DataPipeline` class for handling ETL processes
- Integrated with Ergast F1 API (http://ergast.com/api/f1)
- Features:
  - Robust endpoint validation
  - Intelligent URL construction
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Support for multiple data types:
    - Race results
    - Qualifying results (general and driver-specific)
    - Constructor information
    - Driver statistics

### 3. Data Mapping & Normalization
- Implemented mappings for:
  - Driver IDs
  - Constructor IDs
  - Circuit names and round numbers
  - 2023 F1 season calendar

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Successfully tested various query types:
  - Season-specific race results
  - Driver-specific qualifying performance
  - Constructor points
  - Circuit-specific results

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhanced Data Processing
