# Changelog

## 18.12.1 - **User Connects to TypeRacer (or other Platform via API)**

From what I can see in the frontend:
✅ Connect user works perfectly
✅ User stats are displayed correctly
❌ Fetch data is failing

## 18.12.2 - **User Database allows Fetch & Store Data from TypeRacer API**

🎉 Excellent! We've successfully implemented the user connection flow with data fetching and storage. Let's recap what we've achieved:

1. ✅ User connection with TypeRacer API
2. ✅ Display of user stats in the sidebar
3. ✅ Fetching race history data
4. ✅ Storing race data in PostgreSQL with proper UPSERT handling
5. ✅ Error handling and user feedback

The UI looks clean and professional, and the backend is handling the data reliably. This is a solid foundation for the rest of the application.


## 18.12.3 - **UI Styling**

🎉 Excellent! We've successfully fixed the UI styling by:

1. ✅ Properly importing the global CSS
2. ✅ Setting up the dark theme correctly
3. ✅ Maintaining the Geist font configuration
4. ✅ Keeping the shadcn/ui components intact

The UI now matches the clean, professional design from the original template. The dark theme looks particularly sleek, and all the components are properly styled.
