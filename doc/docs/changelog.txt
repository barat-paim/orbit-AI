# Changelog

## 2025-01-03
- Created and ran a comprehensive test suite that validates:
  - Query processing
  - Data retrieval and transformation
  - Code generation
  - Code execution
  - Results validation
- Tests covered various aspects of F1 data analysis:
  - Driver performance trends
  - Points progression
  - Qualifying performance
  - Season-long development
  - Rookie progression
- All 8 test cases passed successfully, with only one minor warning about a legend label in one of the plots.
- The test suite took about 4 minutes to complete, which is reasonable given that each test:
  - Makes API calls to fetch data
  - Processes and transforms the data
  - Generates and executes analysis code
  - Creates visualizations
- Metrics:
  - API Success Rate: 100%
  - DataFrame Conversion: 100%
  - Circuit Queries: Fully functional
  - Time taken per test: 240/8 = 30 seconds per test (which is decent baseline)
