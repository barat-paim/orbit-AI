✓ Set up billing alerts and usage limits
```

### 2. Cost Spikes
```
Risk:
- Unexpected OpenAI API usage costs
- Railway or Vercel exceeding free tier limits
- Database storage costs

Mitigation:

! Monitor OpenAI API usage closely
! Consider implementing usage quotas
```

### 3. Rate Limits
```

Mitigation:
! Plan database sharding
! Optimize indexes
! Implement query caching
! Consider read replicas
```

### 2. API Sustainability
```
Risk:

```

### 3. Infrastructure Scaling
```
Risk:
- Current architecture limitations
- Single region latency
- Resource constraints

Impact:
- Poor global performance
- Scaling limitations
- Reliability issues

Mitigation:
! Plan multi-region deployment
! Consider Kubernetes migration
! Implement CDN

```

## Operational Risks

### 1. Monitoring Blindness
```
Risk:
- Missing critical issues
- Delayed problem detection
- Unknown system state

Impact:
- Undetected failures
- Slow response times
- User dissatisfaction

Mitigation:
! Set up comprehensive monitoring
! Add health checks
! Implement logging
