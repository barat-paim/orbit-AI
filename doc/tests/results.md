### Performance by Query Category

1. **Basic Stats Queries**
   - Success Rate: ✅ >90% (Pass)
   - Avg Processing Time: ❌ 5.11s (Target: <5s)
   - Sample Generated Requirements:
     ```python
     - /api/f1/races: {season: '2023'}
     - /api/f1/laps: {season: '2023'}
     - /api/f1/constructors: {season: '2023'}
     ```

2. **Driver Comparison Queries**
   - Success Rate: ✅ >90% (Pass)
   - Avg Processing Time: ❌ 5.39s (Target: <5s)
   - Sample Generated Requirements:
     ```python
     - /api/f1/drivers: {season: '2023', driver: ['max_verstappen', 'lewis_hamilton']}
     - /api/f1/qualifying: {season: '2023', driver: ['max_verstappen', 'lewis_hamilton']}
     ```

3. **Historical Trends Queries**
   - Success Rate: ✅ >90% (Pass)
   - Avg Processing Time: ❌ 8.03s (Target: <5s)
   - Sample Generated Requirements:
     ```python
     - /api/f1/constructors: {season: ['2015'...'2023'], constructor: 'ferrari'}
     - /api/f1/drivers: {season: ['2014'...'2023'], driver: 'lewis_hamilton'}
     ```

### Identified Issues

1. **Performance Issues**
   - All query categories exceed 5s processing time target
   - Historical queries significantly slower (8.03s)
   - Multiple GPT-4O API calls per query increasing latency

2. **Coverage Gaps**
   - Zero coverage in 4 modules
   - Core processor only at 55% coverage
   - Missing edge case testing

3. **Test Framework Issues**
   - Test fixture error in test_query_category
   - Incomplete error handling coverage
   - Limited validation of generated requirements

### Feature Backlog

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement query caching for common patterns
   - [ ] Optimize GPT-4O prompt engineering
   - [ ] Add batch processing for historical queries
   - [ ] Investigate parallel processing options

2. **Coverage Improvements**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for edge_test.py
   - [ ] Implement integration tests for test_runner.py
   - [ ] Add validation tests for user_queries.py
   - [ ] Expand processor.py test coverage

3. **Test Framework Enhancements**
   - [ ] Fix test_query_category fixture
   - [ ] Add more granular requirement validation
   - [ ] Implement mock GPT-4O responses
   - [ ] Add performance profiling

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add tests for malformed queries
   - [ ] Implement timeout handling
   - [ ] Add rate limit handling
   - [ ] Test error recovery scenarios

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix test fixture error in test_query_category
   - Review performance target of 5s (might be too aggressive)
   - Add caching for historical queries

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Increase test coverage of core processor
   - Implement basic error handling tests
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Achieve 80%+ coverage across all modules
   - Implement comprehensive edge case testing
   - Add automated performance regression testing

### Notes
- Query processor shows good accuracy in endpoint/parameter generation
- Performance issues mainly in API call latency
- Test framework needs robustness improvements
- Consider separate performance targets for different query types 

### Proposed Cleanup
The following files appear redundant or deprecated based on test results:

1. `app/query/test_runner.py`
   - Reason: Functionality now covered by new pytest-based test framework
   - Status: Safe to remove

2. `app/query/test_runner_with_pipeline.py`
   - Reason: Duplicate functionality, merged into full_test.py
   - Status: Safe to remove

3. `app/query/edge_test.py`
   - Reason: No coverage, functionality moved to test_query_processor.py
   - Status: Safe to remove after verifying edge cases are covered

4. `app/query/user_queries.py`
   - Reason: Functionality moved to TestQueries class
   - Status: Safe to remove
