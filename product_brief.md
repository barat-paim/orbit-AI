# F1 Data Pipeline Project Brief

## Achievements

### 1. Query Processing System
- Implemented `QueryProcessor` for natural language query interpretation
- Successfully converts user queries into structured data requirements
- Handles various query types (races, qualifying, drivers, constructors)

### 2. Data Pipeline Implementation
- Created `DataPipeline` class for handling ETL processes
- Integrated with Ergast F1 API (http://ergast.com/api/f1)
- Features:
  - Robust endpoint validation
  - Intelligent URL construction
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Support for multiple data types:
    - Race results
    - Qualifying results (general and driver-specific)
    - Constructor information
    - Driver statistics

### 3. Data Mapping & Normalization
- Implemented mappings for:
  - Driver IDs
  - Constructor IDs
  - Circuit names and round numbers
  - 2023 F1 season calendar

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Successfully tested various query types:
  - Season-specific race results
  - Driver-specific qualifying performance
  - Constructor points
  - Circuit-specific results

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhanced Data Processing
- [ ] Add data transformation layer for standardized output
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add support for historical data comparison

### 2. API Extension
- [ ] Add support for additional endpoints (e.g., championship standings)
- [ ] Implement pagination for large data sets
- [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities

### 3. Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request timeout handling
- [ ] Enhance input validation for edge cases

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement concurrent requests for multiple data points
- [ ] Add response compression
- [ ] Optimize URL construction for complex queries

### 5. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Create usage examples and tutorials 


**WEEK 5**
Test Results Summary
Query → JSON (API Fetch):
Success Rate: 100% (8/8 queries)
All API calls successfully retrieved data
Some retries were needed (e.g., for Max Verstappen's data) but eventually succeeded
JSON → DataFrame:
Success Rate: 87.5% (7/8 queries)
Failure Rate: 12.5% (1/8 queries)
Main failure reason: Empty DataFrame (1 case)
Working Features
Basic driver performance queries (e.g., Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton)
Season-specific queries
Driver statistics calculation
Circuit-specific filtering
Qualifying data retrieval

Issues Identified
Data Transformation:
Empty DataFrame issue with qualifying data for Charles Leclerc at Monaco
Circuit filtering might be too strict (e.g., exact match vs. partial match)
API Response Handling:
Some requests require retries due to connection issues
Need better handling of chunked responses
Root Causes
Circuit Name Matching:
Current implementation might not handle circuit name variations well
Need to normalize circuit names or use circuit IDs consistently
Data Validation:
Missing validation steps between JSON parsing and DataFrame creation
No clear error propagation from data transformation to response
