I'll write a high-level design specification for the backend developer to understand the requirements of this interface. This will help them create a backend that integrates seamlessly with the frontend we've developed.

# High-Level Design Specification for DataViz AI Backend

## 1. Overview

DataViz AI is a data analysis chat interface inspired by Perplexity, focusing on producing charts and visuals instead of text answers. The frontend is built with React and Next.js, utilizing a dark theme and a layout similar to Perplexity.

## 2. Main Features

- User authentication and session management
- Natural language processing for user queries
- Data analysis and chart generation
- Real-time communication for streaming responses
- History management for past queries and results


## 3. Data Requirements

- User data: profile information, preferences, query history
- Analysis data: datasets for analysis, generated charts, cached results
- System data: logs, performance metrics, error reports


## 4. API Endpoints

Implement RESTful API endpoints for the following functionalities:

a. User Management:

- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- GET /api/user/profile
- PUT /api/user/profile


b. Query Processing:

- POST /api/query
- GET /api/query/id
- GET /api/query/history


c. Chart Management:

- GET /api/chart/id
- POST /api/chart/generate


d. Data Source Management:

- GET /api/datasources
- POST /api/datasources
- PUT /api/datasources/id
- DELETE /api/datasources/id


## 5. Real-time Communication

Implement WebSocket connections for:

- Streaming partial results as the analysis progresses
- Updating chart data in real-time
- Notifying users of completed analyses


## 6. Backend Technologies

Consider using:

- Node.js with Express.js or Nest.js for the API server
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Python with libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data analysis and chart generation
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for advanced machine learning capabilities


## 7. Natural Language Processing

Integrate a NLP system to:

- Parse user queries
- Identify data analysis intents
- Extract relevant parameters for chart generation


## 8. Chart Generation

Develop a modular chart generation system that can:

- Support various chart types (line, bar, pie, scatter, etc.)
- Customize chart appearance based on user preferences
- Generate chart data in a format compatible with frontend charting libraries


## 9. Security Considerations

- Implement JWT for authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection


## 10. Performance Optimization

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data and query results
- Use database indexing for faster queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Consider using a CDN for serving static assets and cached results


## 11. Scalability

- Design the system to be horizontally scalable
- Consider using microservices architecture for different components (e.g., auth service, query service, chart generation service)
- Implement load balancing for distributed processing of queries and chart generation


## 12. Monitoring and Logging

- Implement comprehensive logging for all system activities
- Set up monitoring for system health, performance metrics, and error rates
- Create alerts for critical issues or performance degradation


## 13. Testing

- Develop unit tests for all core functionalities
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Set up end-to-end tests to ensure smooth interaction between frontend and backend


## 14. Documentation

- Create detailed API documentation using tools like Swagger
- Maintain up-to-date database schemas and data flow diagrams
- Document all third-party integrations and their configurations


This high-level design specification provides a comprehensive overview of the backend requirements for the DataViz AI project. It covers the main features, data requirements, API structure, and important considerations for security, performance, and scalability. The backend developer can use this as a starting point to create a robust and efficient backend system that integrates seamlessly with the frontend interface we've developed.
