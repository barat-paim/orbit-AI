# Multi-Model System for F1 Analysis

## Problem Statement
Our F1 analysis system currently uses multiple AI models for different stages of analysis, each with its own strengths and capabilities. We need to design a system that can effectively manage and coordinate these models while remaining flexible for future additions.

### Current Models
1. **Query Understanding**
   - GPT-4-mini: Efficient at parsing user queries into structured requirements
   - Primary use: Converting natural language queries into data requirements

2. **Code Generation**
   - Claude: Strong at generating analytical Python code
   - GPT-4: Alternative model with different strengths in code generation
   - Primary use: Converting data requirements into executable analysis code

3. **Direct Analysis**
   - GPT-4 Assistant: Capable of zero-shot analysis using database context
   - Primary use: Direct analysis without intermediate code generation

### Challenges
1. Model Selection
   - Need for dynamic model switching based on query type
   - Different models have different costs and performance characteristics
   - Some queries might benefit from specific models

2. System Coordination
   - Models need to work together in a pipeline
   - Results from one model feed into another
   - Need to maintain consistency across model interactions

3. Extensibility
   - System should easily accommodate new models
   - Need to support different types of models (query, generation, analysis)
   - Future integration of model variations or completely new approaches

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Model Registry with Strategy Pattern
A registry-based system that maintains separate collections of models for different tasks, allowing runtime model selection and easy registration of new models.

**Key Features:**
- Separate registries for query, generation, and assistant models
- Runtime model swapping
- Configuration-driven model selection

### 2. Pipeline-Based Model Chain
A linear pipeline system that processes queries through a sequence of models, with clear handoffs between stages and conditional routing.

**Key Features:**
- Sequential processing flow
- Clear model interaction boundaries
- Conditional routing between generation and direct analysis

### 3. Service-Based Model Architecture
A comprehensive service architecture that handles model management, routing, metrics, and execution in a production-ready manner.

**Key Features:**
- Built-in metrics and monitoring
- Model versioning support
- Fallback mechanisms
- Production-ready infrastructure

## Considerations for Implementation
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Cost tracking and management
- Error handling and recovery
- Testing and validation
- Model versioning and updates
- API consistency across models

## Next Steps
1. Select preferred architecture based on current needs and future scalability
2. Define detailed implementation plan
3. Create migration strategy from current system
4. Establish testing and validation procedures



## Proposal Architecture

After reviewing the suggested approach, here are the key changes I plan to make:

1. **File Structure Changes**
```
backend/app/analyst/
├── assistants.py      # New file: Model definitions & registry
├── pipeline.py        # New file: Pipeline orchestration
├── models/           # Renamed from current model files
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py       # Base model interfaces
│   ├── gpt4_mini.py  # Query understanding model
│   ├── claude.py     # Code generation model
│   ├── gpt4.py       # Code generation model
│   └── gpt4_assistant.py  # Direct analysis model
└── config/
    └── models.yaml    # Model configuration
```

2. **Implementation Plan**

a. **Step 1: Base Interfaces**
```python
# models/base.py
class BaseQueryModel:
    async def query_understanding(self, query: str) -> DataRequirements:
        raise NotImplementedError

class BaseGenerationModel:
    async def code_generation(self, df: pd.DataFrame, requirements: DataRequirements) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError

class BaseAssistantModel:
    async def direct_analysis(self, context: dict) -> AnalysisResult:
        raise NotImplementedError
```

b. **Step 2: Model Registry**
```python
# assistants.py
from .models import GPT4Mini, ClaudeModel, GPT4Model, GPT4Assistant

MODEL_REGISTRY = {
    "query": {
        "gpt4-mini": GPT4Mini(),
    },
    "generation": {
        "claude": ClaudeModel(),
        "gpt4": GPT4Model(),
    },
    "assistant": {
        "gpt4-assistant": GPT4Assistant(),
    }
}
```

c. **Step 3: Simple Pipeline**
```python
# pipeline.py
class AnalysisPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.query_model = MODEL_REGISTRY["query"][config["query_model"]]
        self.generation_model = MODEL_REGISTRY["generation"][config["generation_model"]]
        self.assistant_model = MODEL_REGISTRY["assistant"][config["assistant_model"]]
        self.logger = setup_logger()

    async def process(self, query: str) -> AnalysisResult:
        try:
            # Log start time
            start = time.time()
            
            # Query understanding
            requirements = await self.query_model.query_understanding(query)
            self.logger.info(f"Query processed in {time.time() - start}s")

            # Data fetching (existing pipeline)
            data = await fetch_data(requirements)

            # Choose analysis path
            if self.should_use_assistant(requirements):
                result = await self.assistant_model.direct_analysis({
                    "query": query,
                    "data": data
                })
            else:
                code = await self.generation_model.code_generation(data, requirements)
                result = await execute_code(code)

            return result

        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Pipeline error: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

3. **Minimal Metrics Implementation**
```python
# metrics.py
class MetricsLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = defaultdict(list)

    def log_latency(self, model: str, operation: str, duration: float):
        self.metrics[f"{model}_{operation}_latency"].append(duration)

    def log_success(self, model: str, operation: str, success: bool):
        self.metrics[f"{model}_{operation}_success"].append(success)

    def get_summary(self) -> dict:
        return {
            k: {
                "mean": np.mean(v),
                "count": len(v),
                "success_rate": np.mean(v) if "success" in k else None
            }
            for k, v in self.metrics.items()
        }
```

4. **Configuration**
```yaml
# config/models.yaml
default:
  query_model: gpt4-mini
  generation_model: claude
  assistant_model: gpt4-assistant

experimental:
  query_model: gpt4-mini
  generation_model: gpt4
  assistant_model: gpt4-assistant
```

Key Features:
1. Simple model switching through configuration
2. Basic metrics collection
3. Clear separation of model implementations
4. Minimal error handling with logging
5. Easy to extend with new models


## Expert Review

Recommendation
	1.	Start With a Minimal Pipeline Orchestrator
	•	Model Registry (YAML or JSON config) for quick registration and selection of models.
	•	Pipeline (simple Python scripts or Airflow-like DAG) that chains models in sequence.
	2.	Integrate Fast Feedback Loops
	•	Logging & Metrics: Log model latencies, success rates, and partial outputs (e.g., via Prometheus or lightweight logging).
	•	A/B Testing: Toggle models (GPT-4 vs. Claude) at runtime to gauge performance and cost.
	3.	Keep Fallbacks & Error Handling Minimal
	•	If a model fails, gracefully return an error or switch to a different model in the registry.
	•	Do not over-engineer robust retry or queuing until you identify bottlenecks.
	4.	Incremental Enhancements
	•	Gather insights from real usage, then optimize pipeline concurrency or expand fallback logic as needed.
	•	Future-proof by keeping each model wrapped in a standard interface so you can swap out or add new models quickly.

This approach enables rapid iteration and performance measurement without slowing down experimentation.
